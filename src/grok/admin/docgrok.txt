DocGrok
=======

The Grok's personal doctor.

DocGrok is meant as a friendly extension of the Zope 3 'builtin'
apidoc feature. It should be easy to handle and informative in
content. Main target are developers new to Grok.

DocGrok is a helper to generate documentation for nearly everything
living in a running Zope 3 instance. Basically it provides
'information'-objects for different types of things, like modules,
classes, functions, textfiles etc.

A ``DocGrok`` therefore is an object wich normally is bound to a
certain entity, which is describable by a dotted path. It provides
special methods to get information about the thing, a certain
``DocGrok`` is bound to.

How to Use it
-------------

DocGrok documentation can be accessed through the web, calling special
URL paths in your Zope 3 instance or (surprise!) directly via Python.


Calling DocGrok through the web
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To get documentation about a special element, call docgrok simply with
`docgrok` as first part of the URL path.

For example documentation about the grok package can be reached using

    http://localhost:8080/docgrok/grok

The admin package, which is located in the grok package can be
accessed directly such:

    http://localhost:8080/docgrok/grok/admin

In this way nearly all things can be described, which can be described
by a dotted name notation and which are accessible at runtime.


Calling the doctor directly
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The doctor can also be reached via Python, naturally:

   >>> import grok
   >>> from grok.admin import docgrok
   >>> doctor = docgrok.DocGrok('grok.admin.docgrok')

This doctor has immediatly a patient, which is denoted by the dotted
path `grok.admin.docgrok`. The dotted path might reference any thing
which lives in the Python environment: a package, a module, a class, a
function or even a file or some interface attribute:

   >>> doctor.getPath()
   'grok.admin.docgrok'

We can also get a filepath, using the `getFilePath()` method. Objects,
which have no filepath always return `None`.

There is not much more information to get from Doc Grok. This is,
because a `DocGrok` only knows very little about the objects. The base
doc is not a specialist, but cares for all objects and elements, which
can not be handled by other specialists.

If we like to get more detailed information, we have to call a
specialist. For example a package doctor, who happens to be called
`DocGrokPackage` :

    >>> from grok.admin.docgrok import DocGrokPackage
    >>> doctor = DocGrokPackage('grok')
    >>> doctor
    <grok.admin.docgrok.DocGrokPackage ...>

Using ``getPath()`` we get the dotted path of the thing, the doctor
cares for:

    >>> doctor.getPath()
    'grok'

Fine. Obviously DocGrokPackages know as much as DocGroks. That's
little. But a ``DocGrokPackage`` knows also about package-things:

    >>> info = doctor.getSubPackageInfos()

will generate infos subpackages contained in the package we are
examining. The ``info`` here is basically a list of dictionaries,
where each dictionary contains a the keys ``url``, ``name`` and
``dotted_name``:

    >>> info
    [{'url': '...', 'dotted_name': '...', 'name': '...'}...]

The ``url`` element is meant as the path 'inside' the
``docgrok``-browser, when ``docgrok`` documentation is watched in a
browser. ``dotted_name`` and ``name`` give the dotted path of a
subpackage and last element of this path respectively.

As said, ``DocGrokPackage`` is only one possible type of 'documenter'
already included in the docgrok module. The different ``DocGroks``
included are documented below in section `the specialists`_ in detail.

So, this is allright if we already know, what kind of thing (a module,
package, etc.) the doctor should examine. Then we can create an
appropriate doctor and retrieve all information we like.

But how can we find out, what kind of thing we examine? Shouldn't this
be a doctors job as well? Right! This is possible and you should *use*
the possibility to determine the most appropriate doctor
automatically.


Getting the right specialist directly
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Often we don't want to visit the base doctor, but a specialist
directly. But how can we tell, what specialist we need? Easy. We use
the function ``docgrok_handle()`` which delivers us a doctor, who
can tell us more:

    >>> from grok.admin.docgrok import docgrok_handle
    >>> thedoc = docgrok_handle('grok.admin.docgrok')
    >>> thedoc
    <grok.admin.docgrok.DocGrokModule ...>

This is correct. `docgrok` of course *is* a python module, so the best
specialist we can get is a `DocGrokModule`. The mentioned function
therefore is some kind of factory, which always gives us a doctor most
appropriate for the kind of thing specified by a dotted path.

We can, for example ask for a different doc like this:

    >>> thedoc = docgrok_handle('grok.admin.docgrok.DocGrok')
    >>> thedoc
    <grok.admin.docgrok.DocGrokClass ...>

and get a class-specific doctor. Because
``grok.admin.docgrok.DocGrok`` *is* a class, this is again the most
appropriate doc we could get.


How to create your own specialist docgrok
-----------------------------------------

At times you might want to create your own sort of DocGrok. This might
be due to the fact, that you have written a special kind of 'thing' (a
special class, module, whatever), whose special attributes, methods,
etc. should be made available in documentation in a special way.

Thanks to Martijn Faassens ``martian`` package, this can be done very
easily. All you need is a handler function, which is able to determine
from a dotted path, whether some 'thing' is of the type you want
special documentation for, and, of course, a special docgrok, which is
able to deliver the special information about your new 'thing'.

Let's see how this works.

Writing new DocGroks
++++++++++++++++++++

Consider we want to document ``grok.View`` classes. Since
``grok.View`` is a class, we choose the DocGrokClass as base for our
new DocGrok:

    >>> from grok.admin.docgrok import DocGrokClass

    >>> class DocGrokGrokView(DocGrokClass):
    ...     """"This doctor cares for grok.Views."""
    ...     pass

Now we create a doctor:

    >>> doctor = DocGrokGrokView()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        [...]
    TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)

Oops! Well, we didn't specify, what kind of DocGrokView we want to
examine. We can do that, giving a dotted name:

    >>> doctor = DocGrokGrokView('grok.View')
    >>> doctor
    <DocGrokGrokView ...>

The doctor is in. Fine. So let's see, what he can tell us about
``grok.View``.

    >>> doctor.getPath()
    'grok.View'

Ah, yes, very interesting. We got the dotted path of the examined
class. But, where can we find the definition of it in file system? Ask
the doc:

    >>> pnorm(doctor.getFilePath())
    '.../grok/__init__.py'

This is not exactly, what we wanted to know, is it? We got the package
location instead of the module. So the path is wrong. Really? When you
have a look at the specified ``__init__.py``, you will discover, that
there is indeed an assignment, which says, that ``grok.View`` is
another name for ``grok.components.View``. It is simply a shortcut. So,
as we asked for ``grok.View`` the answer was correct.

To check it, let's see, what happens, if we give the real dotted path:

    >>> doctor = DocGrokGrokView('grok.components.View')
    >>> pnorm(doctor.getFilePath())
    '.../grok/components.py'

Ah, right. This is, what we wanted. Now we can use some of the derived
methods to gather some more information about this class:

    >>> methods = doctor.getMethods()

delivers us a list of all public methods defined in this class. Each
list entry being a dictionary with keys ``name``, ``signature``,
``doc``, ``interface``, ``attr``, ``read_perm`` and `` write_perm``.

    >>> entry = [x for x in methods if x['name'] == 'url'][0]
    >>> entry['name']
    'url'
    >>> print entry['doc'].strip()
    Return string for the URL based on the obj and name. The data
    argument is used to form a CGI query string.
    >>> entry['signature']
    '(obj=None, name=None, data=None)'

The other methods work as described in the ``DocGrokClass``
documentation.

This is all very well, but not too impressive. We could gather the
information delivered relatively easy writing some simple
snippets. So, what is it all about?

One main reason is, that ``DocGroks`` are used by the Grok admin
interface to provide easy accessible API documentation. Those
documentation is basically able, to give some information about
everything, which is describable as a dotted path. But some of the
information is not very descriptive. That's it, why ``docgrok`` uses a
set of helpers, to give more detailed information. If you, for
instance, want that instead of the standard class-related docgrok your
own docgrok is displayed, whenever a user wants to know something
about ``grok.View`` and related classes, then you can register your
docgrok and let it display documentation for ``grok.View``.

The selection to register a docgrok for ``grok.View`` was very
arbitrary. You can also register a docgrok, that handles all elements,
whose name starts with the letter 'a' or those elements, which are
classes and implement at least three different interfaces. It's
completely up to you.

To choose, which API elements your docgrok is able to handle, you have
to define a handler class. This is what we want to do next.


Create a handler and register your new docgrok
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Those steps are described in the ftests for the docgrok module in
grok.ftests.admin.docgrok. There you can also find examples, how to
create own docgrok documentation (see the lower parts of the file).
