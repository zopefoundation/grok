Grok changes
************

0.11.2 (unreleased)
===================

Bug fixes
---------

* Port fix of zope.formlib to correctly adapt the context to a FormField's
  interface, not the field'

* Fix bad security hole.

0.11.1 (2008-01-20)
===================

Bug fixes
---------

* Do not register the publishTraverse and browserDefault methods of the
  JSON component as views.

* Methods with names that start with an '_' are not registered as views
  for XMLRPC, REST and JSON components.

* Use a configuration action for the registration of the static directory.

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/161948: grok.testing.grok()
  now also loads the ZPT template factories so that unit tests that
  need to configure views with ZPT templates continue to work.

* Changed a few remaining references to ``grok.grok`` and
  ``grok.grok_component`` to their correct equivalents in
  ``grok.testing``.

* ``grok.testing.grok_component()`` could not be used in a pure
  doctest. This needed a bugfix in Martian (since 0.9.2). Add a test
  that demonstrates this problem.

* Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/162437: grok.Form and its
  subclasses did not implement IBrowserView.

0.11 (2007-11-08)
=================

Feature changes
---------------

* Integrated skins and layers: ``grok.layer``, ``grok.IGrokLayer``,
  ``grok.Skin``.

* Grok now supports hooking in new template languages without much work.
  See also doc/minitutorials/template-languages.txt. See Restructuring below
  for more techinical info.

* Accessing a template macro via context/@@the_view/the_template is now
  deprecated for the standard ZPT story of using
  context/@@the_view/macro/the_template.

* There is now a grok.direct() directive that can be used on GlobalUtilities
  to mark that the class provides the utility interface directly and need
  no instantiation.

* Removed ``grok.define_permission`` in favor of the
  ``grok.Permission`` component base class. You should now subclass
  this base class to define permissions. See also
  doc/minitutorials/permissions.txt

* Added the ``grok.Role`` component base class to define roles.

* The admin UI now displays and offers deletion of broken objects.

* Removed support for defining model schemas using an inner class with
  the special name ``fields``. This was abandoned in favor the usual
  Zope 3 way of defining schemas in interfaces and implementing them
  in our Grok models.

* Integrated REST support. See doc/minitutorials/rest.txt for usage
  information.

Bug fixes
---------

* Remove zc.recipe.egg, zc.recipe.filestorage, zc.recipe.testrunner,
  zc.zope3recipes from version requirements.

* The admin UI now shows interfaces in modules.

* ``handle...`` is not a special function name anymore.

* Views no longer need a custom ``AbsoluteURL`` view to determine
  their URL, since each instance now properly gets a ``__name__``
  attribute.

* buildout.cfg extends versions.cfg to pin down the versions of the
  dependency tree. See also http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/readme.html

Restructuring
-------------

* Grokkers now emit configuration actions, much like ZCML directive
  handlers do. If you defined custom grokkers, see doc/upgrade.txt for
  more information.

* The new pluggable template language support includes some restructuring:

  - GrokPageTemplate is now split up into two. BaseTemplate, on which all
    templates need to be based, and GrokTemplate, which also provides a
    set of methods for easy integration of templating languages.

  - All objects based on GrokTemplate are now grokked, instead of having
    separate grokkers for each type of template.

  - The View is now completely template-language agnostic, which makes it
    easy to hook in new page template languages.

  - There are now new interfaces (ITemplate and ITemplateFileFactory)
    used when you implement support for a new templating language.

* Changed the way grok's functional tests are set up.  Instead of each
  test case doing its own test setup, it is now done once by the
  ftesting layer.  This avoids ordering problems when some ftests
  would influence the environment of other ftests that were run later
  in time.

0.10.2 (2007-10-24)
===================

Bug fixes
---------

* Remove zc.recipe.egg, zc.recipe.filestorage, zc.recipe.testrunner,
  zc.zope3recipes from version requirements.

* Require zope.app.error = 3.5.1

0.10.1 (2007-10-10)
===================

Bug fixes
---------

* buildout.cfg extends versions.cfg to pin down the versions of the
  dependency tree. This should avoid the situation where we release
  Grok, some dependency changes, and Grok breaks as a result. In
  conjunction with this we will also be releasing a new version of
  grokproject that will use this version infrastructure by default.

  For more information about this change, see:
  http://grok.zope.org/releaseinfo/readme.html

0.10 (2007-08-21)
=================

Feature changes
---------------

* Integrated admin user interface.

* Configuration using Martian (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/martian).

* Flash message infrastructure included.

* Adjust dependencies for Grok so that grokproject should work on
  Windows.

Bug fixes
---------

* A fix in Martian where multiple grok.Model or grok.Container classes
  could result in something being found as a context twice.
