\date{\today}   % update before release!

                % doesn't cause a new date to be used.  Setting
                % the date to \today can be used during draft
                % stages to make it easier to handle versions.

\release{unreleased}      % release version; this is used to define the
                          % \version macro

\makeindex          % tell \index to actually write the .idx file

\maketitle

    \begin{quote}
    ``Grok means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part
    of the observed --- merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group
    experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion,
    philosophy, and science --- it means as little to us (because we are from
    Earth) as color means to a blind man.'' -- Robert A. Heinlein, Stranger in
    a Strange Land
    \end{quote}

\begin{abstract}
This is the grok reference documentation. It is organized by the Python
artefacts that implement the concepts.

Grok makes Zope 3 concepts more accessible for application developers. This
reference is not intended as introductory material for those concepts. Please
refer to the original Zope 3 documentation and the grok tutorial for
introductory material.
