\chapter{Decorators}

grok uses a few decorators to register functions or methods for specific
functionality.

    \section{\function{grok.subscribe} -- Register a function as a subscriber
    for an event}

        \begin{funcdesc}{subscribe}{*classes_or_interfaces}

        Declare that the decorated function subscribes to an event or a
        combination of objects and events and register it.

        Applicable on module-level for functions. Requires at least one class
        or interface as argument.

        (Similar to Zope 3's \function{subscriber} decorator, but automatically
        performs the registration of the component.)
        \end{funcdesc}

    \section{grok.action}
