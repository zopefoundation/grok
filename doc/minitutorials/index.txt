* `Newbie Permissions Tutorial </minitutorials/permissions.html>`_:

  Zope3 and Grok come with authorization capabilities out of the box. While a
  vanilla Zope3 application protects all content by default and performs
  authorization checks on the content objects themselves, Grok allows access to
  everything unless you explicitly restrict it. The authorization checks here are
  done based on the Views used to access (display/manipulate) the content.

* `Newbie Search Tutorial </minitutorials/searching.html>`_:

  Grok supports the vanilla indexing services available in Zope 3
  straight out of the box. The catalog uses developer-defined indexes
  for searching. In other words, you have to define the indexes you
  want to use to search you objects before you perform the actual
  search.

* `Macros With Grok </minitutorials/macros.html>`_:

  Macros are a way to define a chunk of presentation in one template,
  and share it in others. Changes to the macro are immediately
  reflected in all templates, that use it.

* `XMLRPC With Grok </minitutorials/xmlrpc.html>`_:

  XMLRPC (http://xmlrpc.com) is a spec and a set of implementations
  that allow software running on disparate operating systems, running in
  different environments to make procedure calls over the Internet.

* `Navigating To Transient Objects Tutorial </minitutorials/transient-objects.html>`_:

  Sometimes you need to create objects that do not persist in the ZODB.
  For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to call all such objects
  transient objects. This highlights the fact that, from the point of view of
  Grok, they are going to be instantiated on-the-fly as a user visits them.
